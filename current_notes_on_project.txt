Your CLI will act like a “scaffolding tool” — automating the setup of a project by creating files 
like README.md, .gitignore, requirements.txt, folders like src/ and tests/, 
and optionally setting up a virtual environment.

Under the hood, you’ll write Python scripts that do this file and folder creation,
 string formatting, and organize everything into functions and modules.

You’ll use argparse to handle the command-line interface, so users can run commands
 with options to customize the scaffolding.
